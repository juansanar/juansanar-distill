## Bio

Juan C. Sanchez-Arias<sup>(he/him)</sup> is a medical doctor and neuroscientist working as a Scientific Associate (Experimental Data) at [BenchSci](https://www.benchsci.com/) where he uses his experience in medicine, neurobiology, biomedical research, and experimental design to magnify the impact of BenchSci's platform on empowering preclinical scientists with the most advanced AI to increase the speed and quality of their research. Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Division of Medical Science at the University of Victoria funded by a Michael Smith Health Research BC Award. Juan's research experience includes investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain and heart development, neuronal network and synapse formation, and onset of inherited cardiac arrhythmias combining model organism experimentation, advanced microscopy, and computational biology. His other interests include pathophysiological mechanisms of human disease, bio-image analysis automation, open science, and science outreach and communication.
