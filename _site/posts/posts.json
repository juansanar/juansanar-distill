During that fall I kept finding “twittertorials” on building a website with the above tools and how important an online presence was for academics, especially for us Early Career Researchers.\r\nScreenshot from old website built with hugo-academic + GitHub + NetlifyIn that moment, I decided not to use RStudio and blogdown as part of the process and made all my editing on VS Code as I was at the peak of my honeymoon with the mark-up language Markdown (a honeymoon that continues until today, I love markdown!) and was just getting a grasp of R and RStudio.\r\nManaging a static website through hugo-academic was super fun and I really enjoyed the experience. I gained numerous skills that I always wanted to build up on as someone who has always loved tech, the internet, and more recently, programming.\r\nI’ll miss the site and its features, but I am looking forward to explore and exploit the distill package for R. I find myself using R and RStudo more frequently for my day-to-day activities but also my hobbies and professional development, so this seemed like the most natural step moving forward.\r\nI’m also hopeful that by having my website workflow well integrated with R and RStudio I can continue to advance my data science journey, because let’s face it, we all are data nerd deep inside and love nice plots\r\n\r\n\r\n# Circle plot (example based on https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/226-plot-types-for-circular-plot.html)\r\ncirclize::circos.par(\"track.height\" = 0.4)\r\n\r\ndata = data.frame(\r\n  factor = sample(seq(1,24), 1000, replace = TRUE),\r\n  x = rnorm(1000),\r\n  y = runif(1000)\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Step1: Initialise the chart giving factor and x-axis.\r\ncirclize::circos.initialize( factors=data$factor, x=data$x )\r\n\r\ncirclize::circos.trackHist(data$factor, data$x, bg.col = \"white\", col = \"#69b3a2\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
