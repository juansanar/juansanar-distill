In other words, you can use  to carry on a wide variety of stats, visualize data (in the most beautiful ways out there), as well as implement many other purposes extending beyond statistics (this html document and website was created using !)\r\nYou can get  directly through The R Project website. In their homepage, they’ll have listed the latest available version of R (4.1.2 “Bird Hippie” at the time of writing this post).  is available for the main operating systems (i.e., GNU/Linux, Windows, and macOS). \r\nWhy ?\r\nIs  the ultimate statistical software? Heck yeah! Is it the only option to do stats for your research or hobbies? No. \r\n\r\nThere’s quite a selection of software tools available. I gravitate to R for the following reasons:\r\nFree\r\nOpen source\r\nExtensible\r\nStatistical forward programming language (made by statistician for statistics)\r\nGreat IDE integration (Hi there RStudio! 😄)\r\n\r\nCongratulation! You are now ready to embark your data journey. Ya!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nI have been rocking my personal website through a GitHub + Netlify concoction since its inception in Fall 2018 as I prepared for SfN 2018 in San Diego. During that fall I kept finding “twittertorials” on building a website with the above tools and how important an online presence was for academics, especially for us Early Career Researchers.\r\nScreenshot from old website built with hugo-academic + GitHub + NetlifyIn that moment, I decided not to use RStudio and blogdown as part of the process and made all my editing on VS Code as I was at the peak of my honeymoon with the mark-up language Markdown (a honeymoon that continues until today, I love markdown!) and was just getting a grasp of R and RStudio.\r\nManaging a static website through hugo-academic was super fun and I really enjoyed the experience. I gained numerous skills that I always wanted to build up on as someone who has always loved tech, the internet, and more recently, programming.\r\nI’ll miss the site and its features, but I am looking forward to explore and exploit the distill package for R. I find myself using R and RStudo more frequently for my day-to-day activities but also my hobbies and professional development, so this seemed like the most natural step moving forward.\r\nI’m also hopeful that by having my website workflow well integrated with R and RStudio I can continue to advance my data science journey, because let’s face it, we all are data nerd deep inside and love nice plots\r\n\r\n\r\n# Circle plot (example based on https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/226-plot-types-for-circular-plot.html)\r\ncirclize::circos.par(\"track.height\" = 0.4)\r\n\r\ndata = data.frame(\r\n  factor = sample(seq(1,24), 1000, replace = TRUE),\r\n  x = rnorm(1000),\r\n  y = runif(1000)\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Step1: Initialise the chart giving factor and x-axis.\r\ncirclize::circos.initialize( factors=data$factor, x=data$x )\r\n\r\ncirclize::circos.trackHist(data$factor, data$x, bg.col = \"white\", col = \"#69b3a2\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
