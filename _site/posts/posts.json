    "contents": "\r\nIt’s 2022! Use a reference\r\nmanager ffs\r\nThe tradition of passing information to one generation another one\r\nhas allowed us to use knowledge to our advantage (TODO REF). However,\r\nsuccessfully achieving this requires the ability to track down the\r\norigins of such knowledge and related observations, opinions, etc. by\r\nadding small notes about them within our writing (TODO REF) as\r\nreferences or footnotes. In the past, this was done manually of course\r\n(and you’ll be surprised how many people still follow this ice age\r\npractice) and with the development of technology (e.g., personal\r\ncomputers, text processing software, etc), this labour intensive task\r\ncan be somewhat automated (you still need to gather the information and\r\nmake sense of it of course, though AI is taking major leaps in this\r\nregard).\r\nAnother challenge that accumulating knowledge brings is managing the\r\nsheer amount of content. I wrote a small tidbit about the advantages of\r\nusing a personal knowledge management tool. In this post, I will focus\r\non managing references, specifically, I will try to convince you should\r\nuse a reference manager for:\r\nOrganizing your information sources (e.g., articles, books chapters,\r\ndissertations, newspapers, etc).\r\nInserting and formatting citations into your text editor of\r\npreference (e.g., MS Word, LibreOffice, Google Docs, Zettlr, VS\r\nCode).\r\nCreating and formatting a bibliography.\r\nSo how do we deal with all this information?\r\nSpecialized software such as reference managers are fundamental aids\r\nwhen citing knowledge in our writing, especially within the ivory walls\r\nof academia, where we (“we” as the academic collective through history)\r\nhave created rules and style formats for this purpose, to the point that\r\nalmost every single scholarly journal produces a format that best suites\r\ntheir copyediting and styling.\r\nHow to choose your\r\nreference manager?\r\nWhen it comes to choosing any piece of software, I like to use the\r\nfollowing criteria to guide my decision:\r\nIs it FOSS (Free Open\r\nSource Software)?\r\nI gravitate towards FOSS because it means I can see how the\r\napplication works, but also I can contribute to it and take advantage of\r\nothers contributions (which tend to come in amazing plugins and\r\ncustomization options). Also, who doesn’t like free stuff?\r\n\r\nDoes it have a community backing up or supporting the application?\r\nThis is really important because it makes troubleshooting bugs a\r\nbreeze and not an insurmountable headache.\r\n\r\nDoes it support multiple operating systems and multiple document\r\nwriting software? In other words: does it work on macOS, MS Windows, and\r\nLinux? Does it work with MS Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, and others\r\n(e.g., VS Code, Zettlr)?\r\nAs someone that uses all of these 3 operating systems (macOS for\r\nwork and MS Windows and Linux for personal use) and multiple writing\r\napplications (primairly MS Word, Google Docs, and VS Code), this is a\r\ncritical point.\r\n\r\nIn my case, Zotero check all the boxes and beyond, and it has been\r\nand continues to be my primary recommendation in the internet (e.g., here,\r\nhere,\r\nhere,\r\nhere,\r\nhere,\r\nand so on).\r\nYou get my point, I love Zotero, advocate for Zotero, and no I am NOT\r\nsponsored by Zotero but I have immensley benefited from its flexibility\r\nand cross-platform compatbility. However, in the interest of\r\nexperimentation, I’ll briefly summarize the major names in the reference\r\nmanager game (at least from what I’ve learned from reading and talking\r\nto primarily other folks in academia - there’s another way to manage\r\nyour reference if you’re also a fan of plain text like me, but that’s\r\nfor another day-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZotero\r\nZotero is a free and open\r\nsource. They market themselves as an “easy-to-use tool to help you\r\ncollect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research”. Their browser\r\nextension is blazing fast (probably the fastest out there) and is\r\ncompatible with scientific articles as well as other sources of\r\ninformation, such as blogs, visual media (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.), and\r\nnews article. Also, Zotero can save your library proxies, making your\r\nliterature search way easier when off-campus or working from home\r\nwithout using an institutional VPN (hooray for mobility and\r\nflexibility!.\r\nOne the biggest pros of using Zotero is their community,\r\nwhich is always happy to help troubleshoot through bugs or issues but\r\nalso contribute to the improvement of Zotero’s platform from its core or\r\nby creating plugins that skyrocket your productivity (for example,\r\nZotFile and BetterBibTex).\r\nYou can use Zotero without an account; however this will impede\r\nsynchronization across devices. That said, signing up to Zotero is a\r\nbreeze, they don’t spam their user base and once signed up, you don’t\r\nhave to do it again, it’ll remember you.\r\nCompatible with several document and text editors (MS Office Word,\r\nLibreOffice, Google Docs, Zettlr, VS Code, and the list go on).\r\nMendeley\r\nMendeley started as free\r\nindependent reference manager but was lately acquired by Elsevier, the\r\nmultibillion publisher (although it continues to be free to use.\r\nMendeley also has a browser extension, to which you have to sign in\r\nevery time you want to use (a bit of pain in my humble opinion) and is\r\ndisappointingly slow, even when trying to clip journal articles from\r\nElsevier (you would expect it would work faster within their site).\r\nWhile there no community led plugins, Mendeley offers a mostly hassle\r\nfree experience if you’re willing to wait relatively large amounts of\r\ntime to clip a journal article and constantly having to sign into their\r\nbrowser extension.\r\nExpect to get loads of email (from which you can opt out of course)\r\nfrom them suggesting you papers sccording to your library and recent\r\nvisits to Elsevier owned journals (talk about bias and telemetry,\r\neh?).\r\nCompatible with MS Office Word and LibreOffice.\r\nEndNote\r\nEndnote is probably that old,\r\nunskilled, and not very nice person asking to join the sport game you\r\nand youre friends are enjoying. Gained a lot of traction in earlier\r\ndays, partly because it was the only option available, making its away\r\nacross academics (which more often than not are not very flexible or not\r\nas open to adapt newer, better, more transparent software). Because of\r\nthis, it has a decent following, but it certainly lacks the community\r\nsupport and flexibility from free and open source software and it is not\r\nfree. To compound this, you have to pay each time they upgrade their\r\nsoftware, which is pretty much a must otherwise the compatibility with\r\npopular document editors will be gone.\r\nCompatible with MS Office Word and LibreOffice\r\nPaperpile\r\nNever used it, but Paperpile advocates swear by\r\nits ability to handle .pdf files and annotations. It also integrates\r\nwith Google Docs, in addition to MS Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This,\r\ncombined with the increasingly available RAM in computers (my main\r\ndesktop rig harbours 32 GB, for example) and the expandability of\r\ndesktops within the same operating system session can quickly create a\r\ndisaster of open tabs if one doesn’t pay attention to this matter.\r\nAs shown in the image above, I’ve fallen into the bottomless pit of\r\nmultiple browsers, with multiple tabs across multiple desktop instances.\r\nThe result: 528 open tabs. Yes, 528 tabs. Open. All the time. Using\r\nGoogle Chrome.\r\n\r\nThis also means I haven’t shutdown my computer in a while and even\r\nwhen I did (due to priority security updates for Windows), I immediately\r\nrestored my browser windows and every single one of those 528 tabs.\r\n\r\nBut why? What is the reason underlying this chaos!?\r\n\r\nWithout diving deep into the melting pot inside my head, such chaos\r\nis simply the result of disorganization. More\r\nspecifically, disorganized thoughts and ideas. These\r\n528 tabs represent 528 thoughts and ideas that were not written down,\r\ncategorized, and interconnected in a timely and structured fashion (I\r\nwon’t go over the reasons behind this, but let’s say it’s been busy\r\ntimes at Juan’s camp).\r\nIn other words, I was using multiple tabs as a form of personal\r\nknowledge management system and -damn- it was an awful,\r\nterrible idea.\r\n\r\nPersonal knowledge management? A Personal\r\nKnowledgement Management (PKM) is a process of colelcting\r\ninformation in a structured manner so it is retrievable, shareable, and\r\nescalable. In simpler terms, a system that can be used as your second\r\nbrain. I will talk more about this in a separate post.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found a PKM that meets my needs and sort of behaves like a brain.\r\nPlus, it checks some of my favourite things: markdown-based, local\r\nfirst, and FOSS. This PKM is called dendron\r\n\r\nIt is #TidyTuesday\r\nafter all, so let’s explore what were the most common words present in\r\nthose open tabs.\r\nPackages to use\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(stringr)\r\nlibrary(tidytext)\r\nlibrary(wordcloud)\r\n\r\n\r\nLoading data\r\nI’ve been using TabCopy\r\nfor most of my Chrome experience. It’s a pretty useful extension that\r\nlets users copy the tabs that are open on a browser window (and even\r\nacross multiple browsers windows), which can be easily pasted and save\r\nin a text file for later use. I copied the tabs using the TabCopy\r\n“Extended Format”, where it generates a line with the name of the\r\ntab/website (i.e., the “title”) followed by the URL.\r\n\r\n\r\ntabs <- read_csv(\"data/urls_2022-03-31.txt\", col_names = FALSE)\r\n\r\ntail(tabs)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 × 1\r\n  X1                                                                  \r\n  <chr>                                                               \r\n1 Fig. 1: Cell composition of the adult human heart. | Nature         \r\n2 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2797-4/figures/1         \r\n3 Quantitative cross-species translators of cardiac myocyte electroph…\r\n4 https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg0927?url_ver=Z39.88-2…\r\n5 Bioconductor - RCy3                                                 \r\n6 https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html       \r\n\r\nTidying data\r\nThe above output shows that each website’s name is in\r\nodd rows with and URL’s in even rows.\r\nBecause I like data frames, I want to have a column (variable) with each\r\nwebsite title and another column with its respective URL.
